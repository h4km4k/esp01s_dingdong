Software and schematics for Sidle 6+n (should work for every bell that works with 12V) Doorbell and Dooropener.

The code was written almost exclusively by sschori <https://github.com/sschori/ESP01RelayModul>. Thank you for that.

I just removed a memory leak and added the doorbell/opener code.


Here are a screenshot when the doorbell was not pressed:
